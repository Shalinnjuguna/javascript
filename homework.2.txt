DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DECLARATION,DEFINATION AND INITIALISATION

DECLARATION
Declaring a variable reserves a name and some space in memory for a variable of the specified type, but doesn't give it a value.

example:
 int a; //declarind a variable


DEFINATION
unlike declaration defination states the variable is declared and memory is allocated to the variable,a variable cannot be defined multiple times in the same scope
it is also a defination of a previouslly declared name i.e calling a function is actually a defination

example:
int sum (int a int b) {
return at b;} 
sum (10,5) //function call=function defination

INTIALISATION

unlike declaration and defination intialisation is declaring a variable and assigning a value at the declaration time called intializing a variable.
it also gives the variable a value or body to the function

example:
int a;=10 // initializing variable a
